# Other-VM

:::note
As the MultiversX Sovereign Chains ecosystem grows, additional VMs will be added and described here over time. Each new VM will follow the same integration pattern: assigning a unique base address, implementing the appropriate interfaces (such as `VMExecutionHandler`), and supporting cross-VM calls via the `blockchainHook` mechanism.
